# Build-a-Credit-Risk-Prediction-Model-in-Python
🚀 Credit Risk Prediction Model using a Random Forest Classifier. This model predicts the likelihood of loan defaults based on customer financial data.

📊 Key Features Used in the Model:
Credit Score
Income
Loan Amount
Age
🔧 How It Works:
Data Preprocessing: I used a simple dataset of borrowers with features like credit score, income, loan amount, and age, along with the target variable (loan default).

Modeling: Using Scikit-learn’s Random Forest Classifier, I trained the model on a training dataset and evaluated it on a test dataset.

Model Accuracy: The model was evaluated with metrics like accuracy, classification report, and a confusion matrix, providing clear insights into how well it predicts defaults.

🔍 Results:
The model achieved a high accuracy in predicting loan defaults.
The Confusion Matrix helped visualize where the model did well and where it could be improved.
🔮 Making Predictions:
I used the trained model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults for new borrowers based on their financial information. This could be useful for financial institutions to better assess loan risks.

🚀 Why This is Important:
With the increasing need for financial institutions to assess creditworthiness accurately, machine learning models like this one can significantly improve decision-making and reduce risk.
